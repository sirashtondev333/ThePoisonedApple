Twisted Halloween typeface embodies the chills and mystique synonymous with a moonlit October night. 
Out of the norms, its characters undulate freely, rejecting a fixed baseline, giving each word a personality tinged with a blend of spooky and retro allure. 
Imagine letters that dance like shadows cast by a flickering candle, seemingly sketching tales of witchcraft, mystery, and the eeriness found in episodes of the Twilight Zone. 

Use asterisk * to make a Halloween cat, or multiple asterisks to make different symbols like pumpkins, demons, skulls.
Example: Witch*Craft & Black******Magic
