To do list:
Create a proper search bar
Create a banner for the top that's aesthetically pleasing a la restaurant layout
HAVE MAYBE COOKIES IF YOU DIDN'T USE COOKIES FOR THE TOP OR A PIE IMAGE FOR DISCOVER OUR RESTAURANT STORY
Order Online, maybe have an uber eats or a "we deliver!" section too
Make sure everything is actually where you want it to be.
Pick a font
Add icons to social media at top
Pick a color palette based on the images that you chose.
Make Testimonials small and not white (unless your primary text color is no longer white), and add scrolling like dots at the bottom which will make it look like there are multiple testimonials.
Also add a food picture below opening hours, and if not there within the section so it's not bland. Could be a good place for cake.
